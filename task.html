                    Students often get confused while buying their first 'machine-friends'.
                    Many advertisements from different companies and stores make people to forget about 
                    their aims. In most cases buyers overpay for unnecessary characteristics of the laptop.
                    You have to define for what else you are gonna use it clearly. <br><br>
                    For instance, I have many friends who bought laptop for gamers, while 
                    they didn't use to play computer games. Note, those types are expensive for special
                    graphics cards. There are many similar cases. <br><br>
                    Below are listed only standard criteria.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="paragraphs"> 
                <a name="display"><h2>Display</h2></a>
                <img src="forArticle02.jpg" width="100%" height="400px"/>
                <p class="texts">Because you will be using your computer for 
                    several hours every day, the quality of the display plays an important role.
                    Generally, most cheap laptops provide screen only with 1366 x 768px. That
                    is suitable for people who do not use their computers a lot. Working in front of screen 
                    with around 1366 x 768px for long time make your eyes to get tired quickly.<br> <br>
                    Search for a Full-HD screen. Resolution must be high. This may cost 
                    quitely more expensive, but remember about your eyes.<br><br>
                    Also, make sure that the display has comfortable viewing angles.

                <p class="texts">CPU is a brain of computer, it is responsible for
                    performance of commands sent by you. CPU stands for Central
                    Processing Unit. The time rate is measured by Hz. 
                    The higher the rate, the more actions 
                    it can perform at exact amount of time. That is, you should pay attention
                    at the speed of the processor (CPU).<br><br>
                    Intel's processors got popular nowadays, which are considered to be
                    the most efficient processors. So you will see only them at most.
                    There are several spread versions, even if they are old. Do not buy
                    Intel i3. It is much slower than Intel i5 and i7. Actually there isn't
                    big difference between Intel i5 and i7, so if there is no need to overpay
                    for later version of these 2. <br><br>
                    Also, pay attention on the amount of cores. The more they are, the 
                    faster your computer calculates.<br><br>
                    Here is 1 example of CPU notion in stores. Intel Core i5-7300HQ.<br>
                    7 is for generation. 7th and higher generation are good.<br>
                    300 is for measurement of performance, actually this depends on other CPU 
                    parameters.<br>
                    H is important for 3D modeling. Find more about it, if you plan
                    to learn modeling deeply during study.<br>
                    Q means that the processor contains 4 cores. This is good for
                    programmers. Note: when you see U or Y instead, the processor has only 2 cores
                    or it means that the performance level is low.
                    This is unsatisfactory for software engineering.

                <a name="ram"><h2>RAM</h2></a>
                <p class="texts">For projects of the hardness at the average level the minimum
                    amount of space in RAM is 16GB. But, because you only study, 
                    your laptop's RAM can contain lower. Note: 4GB is needed at least.<br><br>
                    RAM stands for Random-Access-Memory. This is like computer's work area 
                    for executing a program. The reason why RAM's space is important is that, 
                    bofore the program is executed in CPU, it goes to computer's memory.
                    During hard programs' executions small amount of memory space in 
                    working device gives out errors.<br><br>
                    Note: modern programs consume a lot of space. 8GB and 16GB are better
                    choices. But for the study of 3-4 years 4GB is also acceptable.

                <p class="texts">
                    The main criterion that must be mentioned is the type of hard disc.
                    Choose SSD, it is faster than the standard hard disc. Presence of 
                    SSD is one more factor for price to be higher. With SSD every operation
                    will be executed faster: programs' compilation time, projects' loading,
                    applications' launching, etc.<br><br>
                    The minimum capacity of SSD must be 256GB. Just imagine your phone
                    having very low storage capacity. It is annoying sometimes.
                    Many warnings come from the system that the space is not enough after
                    certain time of use. The same thing eith computer. If you save your money 
                    for lower space of SSD, you will meet such problems very soon.
                    Of course, this doesn't affect on programs execution. But your data 
                    must be back-upped in correct way.

                <a name="additionalProperties"><h2>Additional properties</h2></a>
                <p class="texts">As it was mentioned earlier, define your aims
                    before you choose your laptop. There maybe more criteria 
                    for your laptop accordimg to your interests. During the study time,
                    you can use your computer for computer games, video editing,
                    photoshop, and all other hobbies.<br><br>
                    Here are some additional parameters of computers, that are not very
                    important as the previous ones, but also play a big role in some
                    usage.<br><br>
                    <b>Graphics card</b><br>
                    This is very necessary for mobilography, 3D modeling, computer games.
                    There are 2 types of video cards: built-in and discrete. 
                    Only discrete video cards are appropriate for this use.<br>
                    nVidia is strongly resommended. This company's cards are usually
                    named as GeForce. Here is the example of nVidia's video cards
                    notion: GeForce GTX1050. The last 2 digits show the level of 
                    performance. The first ones show the generation. The later generations
                    are more suitable. <br><br>
                    <b>Compactness</b><br>
                    Because you are a student, you always carry your laptop with
                    yourself. Do not buy too heavy laptops. It makes you tired sometimes.<br><br>
                    <b>Keyboard</b><br>
                    Try to type on the laptop before the purchase.
                    The keyboard must be suitable for your work. Do not buy laptops
                    with too large or too small keyboards.
